## Overview
Miner is a high speed melee character, who uses high mobility and invincibility in fast-paced combat. 
Sounds somewhat like Mercenary, but where Mercenary slips in and out, Miner rushes in and swings wildly like a crackhead.

- His primaries, coupled with his passive `Gold Rush` encourage you to be offensive to build long kill combos.
- `Drill Charge` and `Backblast` are high mobility options with invincibility during and slightly after their dashes. 
- `Drill Charge` will always go the full distance, and increases damage by being held to charge longer.
- `Backblast` can be held to go backwards farther. Use as a long mobility option, or to stay in combos.
- `To the Stars`, when used correctly, can land huge damage on larger enemies.

Read Gnome's original mod page for more detailed descriptions. Gameplay is still the same for the most part

## Direseeker (Disabled by default)
Adds a custom boss, Direseeker, along with Miner. Disables itself if the standalone Direseeker mod is installed. The one included in this mod is basically Direseeker lite.

Direseeker is a massive Elder Lemurian with currently a new extremely powerful fireball attack. It's roughly Imp Overlord tier and only spawns on Abyssal Depths.
